/**
	@name FileEdit

	A virtual class. Intended to suspport a simple and easy use and override for what ever changes that one would like
	to make to any writable file.
	The constructor saves all the variables he's being given to,
	changing the name of the original file, adding it a 'copy' string before it's suffix,
	and then opening 2 streams: the original file - for reading, and the new file that it's name was changed
	for writing.
	Note - the constructor can throw a runtime exception
	The actual editing is being done with a token that is being searched for, that was given in the constructor.
	The Edit function uses a search method that search for the token, and then calling the virtual InsertContent method
	for inserting the content in whatever way.
	If the token wasn't found - SearchToken throws a runtime error
	At last, when all the expected token were found, the rest of the original file is being copied to the new one,
	if there was a closing line in the constructor, it's being inserted
	and then closing the stream using CloseStreams.

	There is an extra method - DeleteFile - for deleting the new file that was created for keeping the folder simple.
